# LIN
Exercises for LIN (Advance Linux and Android) subject.

  Practice 3, concurrence.

	Part A: Upgrade of the practice 1. Mutex added for concurrence control.

	Part B: construction and installation of a new kernel module that creates a new "/Proc" entry that manages a circular buffer with concurrence control over the buffer.

	Opcional 1: Like Parte B but with kfifo buffer from the kernel instead of cbuffer struct.
